## Project Review

#### Here are a number of comments and suggestions about the project to improve reproducibility and replicability as well as broaden the scope of the analysis.

Replicability Conflicts and Issues with the Scope of Study:

* Need to find a common tag between US cities or an either/or method for querying by city tags. (Currently requires manually updating 20 cities geojson with OSM relation ID and coordinates)
* OSM database is incomplete. (Some buildings are not identified as parking even if they have parking lots under/above)

#### At present, the values calculated in this study can be considered minimums for parking/car-centric landcover.

Future Projects and Project Expansions:

* Need to account for verticality in parking structures
* Could also include other parking/car-centric infrastructure (residential driveways, proportional road cover, car dealerships, etc.)
* Other datasets to supplement the inconsistent OSM dataset
